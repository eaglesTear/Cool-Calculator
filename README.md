# Cool-Calculator
A simple, nicely-styled and standard functioning calculator with a button to display an additional percentage calculator at the side.

It contains all the standard calculator functions, with an ability to change the colour of the display.

It cannot deal with the most complex functioning, especially scientific calculations.

It was built fairly early on in my learning, so I do wish certain aspects had been implemented differently. But it works!
